NOTES FOR JS REFACTORING

1. Display the index of the trades on the traders show page, fetching the trades via an AJAX GET request,
with the backend rendering the trades in JSON format, and then appending the trades to the page.

2. Allow a user to sift through the trades by clicking a 'Next' button on the trades show page, with the next
trade being fetched and rendered via JQuery/AJAX.

3. The rails API must reveal at least one has-many relationship in the JSON that is then rendered to the page.
For example if each of those posts has many comments, you could render those comments as well on that show page.

4. Must use your Rails API and a form to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh.
For example, a user might be able to add a comment to a trade, and the comment would be serialized, and submitted
via an AJAX POST request, with the response being the new object in JSON and then appending that new comment to
the DOM using JavaScript (ES6 Template Literals can help out a lot with this).

5. Must translate the JSON responses into Javascript Model Objects. The Model Objects must have at least one method 
on the prototype. Formatters work really well for this. Borrowing from the previous example, instead of plainly
taking the JSON response of the newly created comment and appending it to the DOM, you would create a Comment
prototype object and add a function to that prototype to perhaps concatenate (format) the comments authors first
and last name. You would then use the object to append the comment information to the DOM.
